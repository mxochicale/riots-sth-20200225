## Title
Fully Open Assess PhD Thesis 

## Abstract:
Pushing the frontiers of knowledge is indeed a great challenge 
but no less important than making such knowledge 
open accessible and reproducible. That said, in this talk 
I will present some lessons I learnt 
during my four-year PhD journey that ended up with the 
first open accessible and %100 reproducible thesis 
since the establishment of the University of Birmingham in 1900.
Furthermore, I will share experiences that helped me 
to put together my thesis such as the use of 
GNU/Linux Ubuntu, 
open-source programming languages, version control tools
and a bit of continuous integration and development.  
Finally, I will talk about open access scientists 
open-source enthusiast who have been inspiring me 
through this journey of trying to become a 
better scientist.

## Bio:
Miguel Xochicale received his BSc in Electronic Engineering at Puebla
Institute Technology (Mexico) in 2004. After completed his MSc in 
Signal Processing at National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and 
Electronics (Mexico), he taught Mechatronics and Computer Engineering 
in various universities in Mexico for five years.
In July 2019, he was awarded a PhD in Computer Engineering at 
University of Birmingham under the supervision of 
Prof. Chris Baber (Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing)
and Prof. Martin Russell (Information Engineering). 
After completing his PhD, he joined the 
School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences. 
as a research associate in which he is pushing forward the 
state-of-the-art of ultrasound guided procedures through 
scientific contributions to 
new algorithms, software and hardware. 
He has 21 years’ experience in human-robot interaction, 
electronics, mechatronics and signal processing, 
along with 13 years’ experience as a teaching assistant 
in Mechatronic and Computer Engineering. 
His lifetime ambition is to advance the fields of Robotics, AI and 
Physics with the hope to contribute with them to the benefit of society.
